# Project Objective

The data collected consists of 561 different features  generated from the raw accelerometer and  gyroscope signals.

Developed two predictive models, Neural Network and SVM using all 561 features. 

For each model, reported: 

1- Accuracy 

2- Confusion matrix 

For SVM model: 	
Varied the number of features using PCA and computed the resulting accuracy

Determined the number of features required to obtain 80% , 90% accuracy
